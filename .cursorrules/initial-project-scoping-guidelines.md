# Initial Project Scoping Guidelines

## Overview

Your first job with any new project is to grok it—to clarify the scope, nature, and type of work—before you charge into execution. The guidelines in this document will help you do that quickly, reliably, and in a way that plays nicely with your constraints.

## Objectives

You have two goals, and two constraints.

Goal #1: Ensure that you fully understand the project as it was communicated to you, so you can prevent yourself from getting off on the wrong foot and working on the wrong thing. If you don't understand, then clarify with the user until you do.

Goal #2: Build an accurate mental model of the relevant high-level detail and context around the project, which you later use to guide your work in the future, without having to re-derive it from scratch every time.

Constraint #1: You want to strike the right balance between doing this quickly and doing this thoroughly. The user is impatient, but also wants you do to a good job.

## Deliverables

Ultimately, you should end up with one deliverable: a detailed restatement of the project that was given to you, in your own words. It will include relevant details that prove that you understand the project and the details and context around it, and that make it useful to "future you" who is having to decide the best course of action for working on the project.

## Process

In the interest of speed and time, you should *skip or shorten any steps* in this process that you feel are unnecessary due to the project being small, simple, clear, and/or easy to understand. Or, vice versa, you should spend *extra time on any steps* that you feel deserve more attention.

1. **Restate the task immediately.**
   In your own words, summarize what the user has asked for. Keep it concise but include all core details. Write this down for yourself.

2. **Identify the type of project.**
   Is this a bug fix? A feature implementation? A data analysis? A refactor? An investigation? A research or planning task? Something else? Maybe a combination of tasks? Recognizing and explicitly stating the category will help determine your approach, as different categories require different approaches. Write this down for yourself.

3. **Extract key requirements and constraints.**
   Look for both explicit and reasonably implicit details, e.g. deliverables, technical requirements, style guidelines, or resource limits. Write this down for yourself.

4. **Surface ambiguities.**
   If important things are unclear, incomplete, or contradictory, list the questions and uncertainties that you have. Write this down for yourself.

5. **Capture relevant context.**
   Note any important background information from the conversation, related docs, or previous projects that could guide your work. The most important doc to look at is the codebase overview, which you can find at `CLAUDE.md`. The context can provide lots of details that might shape how you think about the implicit expectations and requirements for the project, and that also might help you reconcile some of the ambiguities. This is one of the most important steps in the whole process. Write down any conclusions you have that affect your conclusions from steps 1-4.

6. **Decide on a course of action.**
   There are two valid courses of action: either you pause the project to ask the user for clarification and/or alert them of important issues or problems that you've identified, or you feel satisfied with your ability to understand the project and/or resolve and handle any ambiguities yourself. In the latter case, write your detailed restatement (the deliverable). Include both the clarified project description, categorization, and conclusions about requirements+ambiguities+context, so “future you” can jump in without redoing this thinking.
