# Project Planning Workflow

## Overview

This document will walk you through a step-by-step process for planning coding projects that the user requests. Each step references a document that will guide you.

## Steps

1. The first step with a new project is to reason about the scope, nature, and type of the project per [these project scoping guidelines](./project-planning/initial-project-scoping-guidelines.md). Skip this step if the project you're assigned is small, simple, clear expressed, unambiguous, and/or easy to understand. Otherwise, use your Task tool to do this step. It might require you to ask the user for clarification, in which case you should pause the project (these steps) and then repeat from the top once the user responds. Otherwise, this step will result in a clear statement of the project that you can use for step 2 below.

2. Next, use your Task tool to read [these project doc creation guidelines](./project-planning/project-document-creation-guidelines.md) and follow them to create an initial planning document. This step is never optional. Once it's done, you will have a project document with the early sections filled out and placeholders for the later sections.

3. Prepare for this project by following [these project prep guidelines](./project-planning/project-preparation-guidelines.md). This step is required, not optional. Do not use your Task tool for this step overall, as the guidelines themselves may ask you to use your Task tool for sub-components of this step, so read the document (once you get to this step) to find out how to proceed.

4. Finally, based on your prepration, create a phased implementation log by following [these guidelines](./project-planning/implementation-log-guidelines.md). This step is required, not optional. Do not use your Task tool for this step overall, as the guidelines themselves may ask you to use your Task tool for sub-components of this step, so read the document (once you get to this step) to find out how to proceed.
