# 11 – Accessibility

Status: Reviewed for common a11y attributes; no code changes.

## Findings

- Widespread use of `alt`, `aria-label`, and `htmlFor` observed in forms and images.
- Landmark `aria-label="Global"` present on nav elements.

## Opportunities (documented, not applied)

- Verify all interactive elements have discernible text and focus styles.
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG across themes.
- Confirm tab order on modal flows (login, message, meeting) and that focus trapping is correct.

## Manual QA note

- No UI changes made. Recommend running `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` and a quick axe scan in CI for regressions.
