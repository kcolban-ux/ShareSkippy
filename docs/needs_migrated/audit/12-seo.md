# 12 – SEO/metadata

Status: Reviewed metadata, sitemap, and robots; no behavior changes.

## Findings

- Global `metadata` and `viewport` exported from `app/layout.js` via `getSEOTags()` utility.
- `next-sitemap` configured with `siteUrl` defaulting to `https://shipfa.st`; ensure env `SITE_URL` is set in production.
- `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` generated by `next-sitemap` postbuild.

## Opportunities (documented, not applied)

- Set `SITE_URL` in env per deployment to ensure correct canonical URLs.
- Consider adding canonical tags if route structure is fully stable (generated via `getSEOTags` if supported).
- Verify that dynamic routes include accurate `alternates`/`openGraph` where needed.

## Manual QA note

- No SEO content changes made. Confirm that current routes are reflected correctly in generated sitemap.
